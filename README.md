## üìö About

This repository contains the full set of references collected for my research projects.  
It functions as a **reference library**, not just a bibliography for a single paper.  

- **Format**: [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) (`library.bib`)  
- **Viewer**: static site generated at `docs/index.html`  
- **Build process**: `scripts/build_site.py` converts `library.bib` ‚Üí `docs/index.html`  
- **Automation**: a GitHub Action builds & deploys the site on every push  
- **Citation metadata**: see [`CITATION.cff`](./CITATION.cff)

---

## üöÄ Usage

- **Clone or download** this repo to use the `library.bib` file in your own LaTeX, Pandoc, or reference-manager workflow.
- **View online**: the full library is browsable at:

## ‚ú® Description

**Reference Library** is a living, version-controlled collection of references exported from my personal research manager.  
It is intended as a **shared dataset**:  
- transparent and easy to reuse,  
- citable via DOI (when connected with Zenodo),  
- and always available in a simple, open format.
