This approach helps to establish the basis for developing forthcoming recommendations. Design/methodology/approach: The articles were selected through a Systematic Literature Review following the PRISMA guidelines, and utilising Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and the Education Resources Information Center database. Field taxonomy is presented based on the outcomes. Findings: Through a critical review, we offer narrative arguments that document the shortcomings in the existing literature by scrutinising study designs and highlighting suboptimal approaches. Finally, we issue a call to action for future research, envisioning its potential to reorient and reconstruct the field while enhancing the quality of future studies. This proactive stance aims to foster the development of more competent and insightful perspectives, theories, and policy recommendations within design thinking in management education and training. Practical implications: The research in this field holds significant potential for providing valuable practical and policy insights, contingent upon the rigorous and thorough execution of studies. Originality/value: This article presents a robust critical review of 57 state-of-the-art articles investigating design thinking in the context of management education and training.},

Synergies between the disciplines of design and business consulting have increased in the last couple of decades. Design Thinking has emerged as an approach to solve business problems by thinking like a designer to leverage creativity and innovation. Despite its success, this has also raised some criticism: a diffused skepticism toward a public relation term that entails expensive invoices to simply apply old-fashioned creative thinking. What do the real protagonists think of Design Thinking and its application in the business world? We explored the perceptions of designers and business consultants on the theory and practice of Design Thinking. We interviewed 11 such professionals and our findings identified significant differences in perceptions around the essence, practicality and value of Design Thinking. Our research supports calls in the literature for establishing stronger connections between the principles of designerly thinking and the practice of Design Thinking in business.},

Analysis suggests that Archer's ambition for a rigorous 'science of design' inspired by linear algorithmic approaches was increasingly threatened with disruption by his experience of large, complex design projects. Reflecting on Archer's engagement with other models of designing, the article ends with Archer's retrospective view and an account of his significantly altered opinions. Archer is located as both a theorist and someone fascinated by the commercial and practical aspects of designing.},

  abstract = {Interior design is a neglected practice within the broader framework of design theory. Indeed, it is often misunderstood by the general public and sometimes regarded problematically among better-recognized design practices such as graphic design, industrial design, interaction design, and service design. However, with careful attention to the central themes of interior design, one may gain a new perspective on the nature of design itself and the unfolding development of design thinking from the late nineteenth century to the twenty-first century. Foremost among these themes is the transformation of the surrounding physical conditions of our lives into environments for human action and experience. This theme is explored through the creative matrix of the four orders of design, reflecting a shifting focus from place, space, and action to interiors of the mind. Interior design is an interesting and perhaps surprising example of fourth order design, where dialectical humanism plays a central role as an organizing theme for the great diversity of fourth order projects in the twenty-first century.},

As a consequence, automation in the form of artificial intelligence techniques is increasingly applied both to scale traditional recordkeeping activities, and to experiment with novel ways to capture, organise, and access records. We survey recent developments at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and archival thinking and practice. Our overview of this growing body of literature is organised through the lenses of the Records Continuum model. We find four broad themes in the literature on archives and artificial intelligence: theoretical and professional considerations, the automation of recordkeeping processes, organising and accessing archives, and novel forms of digital archives. We conclude by underlining emerging trends and directions for future work, which include the application of recordkeeping principles to the very data and processes that power modern artificial intelligence and a more structural-yet critically aware-integration of artificial intelligence into archival systems and practice.},

  abstract = {This paper reflects on the principles and practices of design in a time of great social change. Its narrative begins with a reflection on the structural reasons why design practices and professions are acquiring even greater social significance than they have had in the past. After a context-setting examination of notions of 'creative economy' and 'knowledge society', the paper moves on to explore the subtly shifting semantics of 'design', tracing key aspects of the changing contexts and practices of design. The paper introduces the notion of a 'shift in the balance of agency', which affects the roles and relationships of designers and users and which increasingly demands design interdisciplinarity. The paper concludes with the suggestion that, given the dramatically changing social and economic terrain in which the design professions are today located, we need to broaden our repertoire of design practices. The case we want to make is this: the changes of our times are of such significance as to suggest that we should rethink the fundamentals of design, its basic principles as well as the dimensions and range of our everyday professional practices. Not only is design now of pivotal significance in newly emerging economic and social orders; what is demanded of design and designers is also changing. Sometimes this represents no more than a subtle shift in tone; at other times, the changes may require us to participate in basic transformations in our ways of conceiving the design processes and doing design work. {\copyright} BERG 2011 PRINTED IN THE UK.},

The first contribution in the series was from Bruce Archer, in the very first issue of Design Studies, and the second was from Gerald Nadler, in Vol 1, No 5. Further contributions are invited. Here, Nigel Cross takes up the arguments for a "third area" of education--design--that were outfined by Archer. He further defines this area by contrasting it with the other two--sciences and humanities--and goes on to consider the criteria which design must satisfy to be acceptable as a part of general education. Such an acceptance must imply a reorientation from the instrumental aims of conventional design education, towards intrinsic values. These values derive from the "designerly ways of knowing" Because of a common concern with these fundamental 'ways of knowing" both design research and design education are contributing to the development of design as a discipline.},

  abstract = {This paper argues that the roles of individual and collective imaginings about the absent or unattainable archive and its contents should be explicitly acknowledged in both archival theory and practice. We propose two new terms: impossible archival imaginaries and imagined records. These concepts offer important affective counterbalances and sometimes resistance to dominant legal, bureaucratic, historical and forensic notions of evidence that so often fall short in explaining the capacity of records and archives to motivate, inspire, anger and traumatize. The paper begins with a reflection on how imagined records have surfaced in our own work related to human rights. It then reviews some of the ways in which the concept of the imaginary has been understood by scholarship in other fields. It considers how such interpretations might contribute epistemologically to the phenomenon of impossible archival imaginaries; and it provides examples of what we argue are impossible archival imaginaries at work. The paper moves on to examine specific cases and ``archival stories'' involving imagined records and contemplate how they can function societally in ways similar to actual records because of the weight of their absence or because of their aspirational nature. Drawing upon threads that run through these cases, we propose definitions of both phenomena that not only augment the current descriptive, analytical and explicatory armaments of archival theory and practice but also open up the possibility of ``returning'' them (Ketelaar in Research in the archival multiverse. Monash University Press, Melbourne 2015a) as theoretical contributions to the fields from which the cases were drawn.},

And how might data-driven approaches help us to increase the transparency of these black boxes and render them critically addressable? Libraries are complex systems comprising a complex interrelationship of staff, space, users and technical infrastructure. However, digital library user studies have not applied the same attention to the creation of large-scale datasets as they have to the ethical and methodological implications of reporting on them. This chapter positions the study of library catalogue data in relation to black box theory and the collections as data imperative. It argues that collaborations between data science, the critical digital humanities, and library and information science can help us to be more transparent in how we reuse catalogue data, and to redefine how this data is created, processed, and documented in the first place.},

In particular, Artificial Intelligence is opening new opportunities for archivists and researchers. However, the experience of scholars (particularly humanities scholars) and other users remain understudied. This article asks how and why researchers and general users are, or are not, using computational methods. This research is informed by an open-call survey, completed by 22 individuals, and semi-structured interviews with 33 professionals, including archivists, librarians, digital humanists, literary scholars, historians, and computer scientists. Drawing on these results, this article offers an analysis of user experiences of computational research methods applied to digitised and born-digital archives. With a focus on humanities and social science researchers, this article also discusses users who resist this kind of research, perhaps because they lack the skills necessary to engage with these materials at scale, or because they prefer to use more traditional methods, such as close reading and historical analysis. Here, we explore the uses of computational and more ``traditional'' research methodologies applied to digital records. We also make a series of recommendations to elevate users' computational skills but also to improve the digital infrastructure to make archives more accessible and usable.},

Introducing a pair of concepts - design-as-practice and designs-in-practice - as an analytical device for discussing design solves a number of problems facing researchers working in design studies. First, it helps researchers see design as a situated, local accomplishment involving diverse and multiple actors. Second, it acknowledges the roles of objects in constituting practices. Third, it de-centers the designer as the main agent in designing. This approach moves away from a disembodied, a historical design thinking to a situated, contingent set of practices carried by professional designers and those who engage with designs, which recognizes the materiality of designed things and the material and discursive practices through which they come to matter. {\copyright} BERG 2012.},

  abstract = {Businesses and the HCI and Interaction Design communities have embraced design and design research. Design research as a field blends methodologies from several disciplines - sociology, engineering, software, philosophy, industrial design, HCI/interaction design -- so designers can learn from past successes and failure and don't have to reinvent the wheel for each new design (whether it's a digital product, a building, an airplane or furniture). They take into account form, function, and, ultimately, users. Many books exist in the research and academic realm for this field, but none create a usable bridge to design practice. Although business people are embracing design, they are not going to become designers. Design researchers need tools to apply their research in the real world. Design Research through Practice takes advanced design practice as its starting point, but enriches it to build a design process than can respond to both academic and practical problems. The aims of the book are to study three design research traditions that cover methodological directions in current leading research community. Taking you from the Lab, Field and to the Showroom, Ilpo Koskinen and his group of researchers show you successful traditions in design research that have been integrated into processes and products. Bridging the gap from design research to design practice, this is a must have for any designer. . Gathers design research experts from traditional lab science, social science, art, industrial design, UX and HCI to lend tested practices and how they can be used in a variety of design projects . Provides a multidisciplinary story of the whole design process, with proven and teachable techniques that can solve both academic and practical problems . Presents key examples illustrating how research is applied and vignettes summarizing the key how-to details of specific projects},

Ironically, this serves to maintain the status quo and stifle progress. Two highly visible techn{\=e} models are intervention design, publicized by IDEO, and enterprise design thinking, popularized by IBM. While distinct, they deploy the same strategy: locate the vectors of organizational change in individual agents---in projects (as complex artifacts) or in professionals (as reified resources)---and implicitly argue that constant proximity or direct contact between design actors and non-design actors is necessary to generate systems change. This constant interfacing, a natural outworking of the techn{\=e} paradigm, ultimately limits real transformation---it ignores the importance of social location and symbolic capital in social systems and assumes that human organizations are deficient by default. As a result, the techn{\=e} paradigm resorts to a ``surplus by numbers'' approach that leads to the excessive proliferation of a suboptimal form of design. For design to flourish in organizations and build better theories, designers need to become more critical of the productive world and critics (in the ameliorative sense of the term) who can reshape the social world.},

  abstract = {Fourth order design, which involves systems and environments, is a frequently misunderstood area of design. The concept of institution offers a way to clarify and enrich fourth order design in both theory and practice. Building on the idea that institutions are active sites of organizational change, this article argues that institutions are objects of design. Specifically, it is an inquiry into the role of institutions and how they provide a sense of durable form and unity, which is sorely missing in our contemporary lives. Using the different modes of thought first pioneered by the philosopher Richard McKeon and imaginatively applied in design by Richard Buchanan, this article introduces a pluralistic framework of institutions to better understand---and, more importantly, shape and reshape---organizations. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for designers to embrace the humility that often accompanies a deep appreciation of institutions as unconventional creations of human making. As complex products that also can take on a life of their own, institutions challenge our inherited understanding of the design process and the role of designers. As formative systems, institutions are re-formable objects that have the power to form designers and design practices anew.},

  abstract = {Taxonomies, especially the ones in specific domains, are becoming indispensable to a growing number of applications. State-of-the-art approaches assume there exists a text corpus to accurately characterize the domain of interest, and that a taxonomy can be derived from the text corpus using information extraction techniques. In reality, neither assumption is valid, especially for highly focused or fast-changing domains. In this paper, we study a challenging problem: Deriving a taxonomy from a set of keyword phrases. A solution can benefit many real life applications because i) keywords give users the flexibility and ease to characterize a specific domain; and ii) in many applications, such as online advertisements, the domain of interest is already represented by a set of keywords. However , it is impossible to create a taxonomy out of a keyword set itself. We argue that additional knowledge and contexts are needed. To this end, we first use a general purpose knowledgebase and keyword search to supply the required knowledge and context. Then we develop a Bayesian approach to build a hierarchical taxonomy for a given set of keywords. We reduce the complexity of previous hierarchical clustering approaches from O(n 2 log n) to O(n log n), so that we can derive a domain specific taxonomy from one million keyword phrases in less than an hour. Finally, we conduct comprehensive large scale experiments to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. A real life example of building an insurance-related query taxonomy illustrates the usefulness of our approach for specific domains.},

AI systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that these decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. More recently some work has been developed in traditional machine learning and deep learning that address such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming more aware of the biases that these applications can contain and are attempting to address them. In this survey, we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and ways they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational Components and the sophisticated Implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational Components: (1) Context Retrieval and Generation, encompassing prompt-based generation and external knowledge acquisition; (2) Context Processing, addressing long sequence processing, self-refinement, and structured information integration; and (3) Context Management, covering memory hierarchies, compression, and optimization. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated System Implementations: (1) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), including modular, agentic, and graph-enhanced architectures; (2) Memory Systems, enabling persistent interactions; (3) Tool-Integrated Reasoning, for function calling and environmental interaction; and (4) Multi-Agent Systems, coordinating communication and orchestration. Through this systematic analysis of over 1400 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI. {\dag} Also affiliated with: (1)Key Laboratory of Network Data Science and Technology, ICT, CAS; (2)State Key Laboratory of AI Safety Corresponding Author},

I consider design knowledge as a collection of different cognitive processes for developing artifacts for the human-made world. Adopting David Kolb's (1984, p.38) definition of learning as ``the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience,'' I discuss the change in design knowledge by examining how the characteristics of designed items have changed. Building on theories by Neri Oxman and Richard Buchanan, I identify relevant areas of design practice in which creativity is breaking free from disciplinary silos to flow between physical, digital, metaphysical, and biological layers. I then propose an updated map of the orders of design as a thinking tool and compass. I read the evolutions of design as it enters the Fifth Order of concerns, characterized by the centrality of data both as input and as output to a design process. Today, design deals with relationships and perceptions; it dialogues with people and all species ranging from machines to micro-organisms, all of which actively participate in reaching objectives. Here, design creates conversations to achieve several goals, including engagement, discovery, and decision making. Finally, I propose a shift in the traditional principles of designing, moving away from the idea of perfect solutions and toward learning systems that are good enough for now.},

Institutions large and small, individually and collectively, have invested in developing, providing access to, and supporting responsible computational use of collections as data. An updated statement is needed in light of increased community implementation of collections as data in context of an ever more complex data landscape. The Vancouver Statement suggests a set of principles for thinking through questions that collections-as-data work produces, as part of an expanding global, interprofessional and interdisciplinary effort to empower memory, knowledge, and data stewards 3 (e.g., practitioners and scholars) who aim to support responsible development and computational use of collections as data. This stewardship role only grows in importance as artificial intelligence applications, trained on vast amounts of data, including collections as data, impact our lives ever more pervasively. The concept of collections-as-data grows out of a particular moment in the history of galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. For decades, practitioners and scholars have been building digital collections. Simultaneously, a diverse range of user groups (e.g., scholars, artists, policy makers, entrepreneurs, journalists, and GLAM practitioners) have drawn upon computational means to derive insights from collections at scale. This work uses a variety of methods, including but not limited to: text mining, computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data visualization, mapping, image analysis, audio analysis, and network analysis. Efforts to support responsible development and computational use of collections have blossomed internationally. Yet, work remains to initiate, support, and socialize approaches that map to a range of local, regional, national, and international resources and strategic priorities. While the specifics of how to develop, provide access to, and support the use of collections-as-data will vary, any digital material can potentially be made available as data that are amenable to computational use. Data use and reuse can be encouraged with appropriate licensing and non-proprietary formats, 3 steward: a person who facilitates and advocates for the long-term access and care of collections. 2 The hyphenated instance "collections-as-data" is used in this document to refer to the concept, community, and area of practice related to supporting responsible computational use of collections as data.},

We could phrase these as the what, how, and who of DH and, of course, RtD.

Various methods have been proposed to facilitate this adaptation, including few-shot fine-tuning, in-context learning, and context distillation. This paper specifically investigates context distillation-a method that extends the utility of task-specific examples by internalizing them, thus augmenting the example set accessible for model inference. We conduct a comparative analysis of context distillation with in-context learning (ICL) and few-shot fine-tuning (FT), aiming to ascertain the efficacy of context distillation in adapting models using minimal in-context examples. Employing matched datasets from Mobach, our experiments leverage OPT models of various sizes. The results indicate that context distillation effectively adapts models, with student models attaining comparable in-domain and out-of-domain accuracies to in-context learning. Although context distillation surpasses ICL in out-of-domain generalization, it does not achieve the performance levels of FT. However, the reduced dataset size and computational demands position context distillation as a viable alternative, especially for smaller datasets. Overall , this study presents context distillation as an efficient and potent method for customizing LLMs to specific tasks.},

Although wicked problems cannot be fully solved, they are urgent and demand intervention. While design thinking was suggested in the 1990s to deal with wicked problems, it is still an open question how it can address moral plurality. In this article, we consider how design thinking can address moral plurality in wicked problems. We propose that designers using design thinking can adopt four normative paradigms toward moral plurality, namely moral agnosticism (design for solutions), moral pragmatism (design for aggregated preferences), moral unificationism (design for community-created values), and transcendental moralism (design for The Good). Then, we argue that designers can address moral pluralism and deal with wicked problems within the first three approaches to normativity, provided that designers acknowledge that their responses to wicked problems may fail over time and require new design responses. Ignoring that possibility fits within the paradigm of transcendental moralism, which does not give designers the means to deal with wicked problems.},

A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers-have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
